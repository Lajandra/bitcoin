- [ ] BA rename X.name to X.client or (X.impl/X.classMethod/X.callsMethod/X.wraps/X.serverName) and change X.name modifier to affect both client & server declarations instead of just server to remove ChainNotifications client overloads
- [ ] BB Get rid of FunctionTraits::Fields, ProxyMethodTraits::Fields move to ClientInvoke
- [ ] BC unify readfield forms. can have single ReadDest class with ReadDest::Return typedef, with ReadField taking ReadDest, RestDestArg... arguments and returning ReadDest::Construct(constructor arg, ReadDestArg...) and Return type either being real destination type or a proxy that emplaces into a vector, or a proxy that updates an existing variable
   - could have ReadDest::Update(lambda) where lambda takes reference argument to object, this allows reading & updating for object types that can't be initialized by constructor. e.g. maps, sets, structs without unserializing constructors
   - designgoal is just to have one ReadField per type, not confusing mix of readfieldupdate/emplace and maze of overloads to fall back to one when another isn't available
   - other goal is to support return types. however i think this may be only useful for client side return values. server side value initialization in PassField could potentially use it to get rid of boost::optional, but this relies of type having move / copy constructor, even if it would be elided, and no guarantee of this for parameters
   - call sequence: readfield pair calls readfield a, calls destfirst::construct, calls readfield b, calls destsecond::construct, calls destpair::construct, calls emplace/emplace/back whatever passed to original readfield
   - class ReadDest
     {
         constexpr bool exists; // can be used to overload readfield more optimally, avoid constructing a temporary when assigning to existing objects for types that can be efficiently deserialized by poth construction or update. should always favor constructing unless this is true
         using Return = ...
         Return Construct(...) or using Construct = ...
         Return Update(Callback) { callback(m_ref); or callback(Construct(); }

     }

     Dest::Return ReadField(...Dest...) {
       return Dest::Update([&](obj) { Stream stream; stream >> obj; } )
     }

     Dest::Return ReadField(...Dest...) {
       return Dest::Construct(unserialize, stream); )
     }
   - Should switch from ReadFieldUpdate to Dest::Return form in:
     - HandleRpcParam server invoke for CRPCCommand::Actor and std::vector<std::string>
- [ ] CA Avoid stream copies with 12254 VectorReader
- [ ] CB Get rid of codegen client return variables, use ReplaceVoid
- [ ] CC Wipe SecureString copies, need RequestHook, ResponseHook, CallContextHook?

src/ipc -- Bitcoin Interprocess Communication
=============================================

The IPC functions and classes in [`src/ipc`](.) allow the `bitcoin-qt` process
to fork a `bitcoind` process and communicate with it over a [socket
pair](https://linux.die.net/man/3/socketpair). This gives the `bitcoin-qt` code
a bit of modularity, avoiding a monolithic architecture where UI, P2P, wallet,
consensus, and database code all runs in a single process.

In the future, the IPC mechanism could be extended to allow other subdivisions
of functionality. For example, wallet code could run in a separate process from
P2P code. Also in the future, IPC sockets could also be exposed more publicly.
For example, exposed IPC server sockets could allow a `bitcoin-qt` process to
control a `bitcoind` process other than the one it spawns internally. These
changes would be straightforward to implement, but would have security,
backwards-compatibility, and maintainablity tradeoffs, so would require more
discussion.


Implementation Details
----------------------

The IPC protocol used is _[Cap'n Proto](https://capnproto.org/)_, but this
protocol could be swapped out for another protocol (like JSON-RPC with long
polling) without changing code outside of the [`src/ipc`](.) directory. No
_Cap'n Proto_ types are exposed in IPC public headers.


### IPC Source Files ###

Here are the important files in the [`src/ipc`](.) directory:


#### Public headers ####

* [`interfaces.h`](interfaces.h)
  – Defines `ipc::Node`, `ipc::Wallet`, `ipc::Handler` interfaces.

* [`client.h`](client.h)
  – Declares `ipc::StartClient` function which spawns a `bitcoind` process and
    returns an `ipc::Node` object controlling it over a socket.

* [`server.h`](server.h)
  – Declares `ipc::StartServer` function which allows a `bitcoind` process to
    open a socket file descriptor and respond to remote commands.

#### Private headers and source files ####

* [`interfaces.cpp`](interfaces.cpp) –
  In-process implementations of `ipc::Node`, `ipc::Wallet`, and `ipc::Handler`
  interfaces that call libbitcoin functions directly.

* [`client.cpp`](client.cpp)
  – Out-of-process implementations of `ipc::Node`, `ipc::Wallet`, `ipc::Handler`
    interfaces that forward calls to a `bitcoind` process over a socket.

* [`server.cpp`](server.cpp)
  – Server IPC code responding to client requests.

* [`messages.capnp`](messages.capnp)
  – Internal _Cap'n Proto_ interface definitions defining the socket protocol.

* [`serialize.h`](serialize.h), [`serialize.cpp`](serialize.cpp)
  – Helper functions for translating IPC messages.

* [`util.h`](util.h), [`util.cpp`](util.cpp)
  – Helper functions for making and receiving IPC calls.


### IPC Classes ###

* `ipc::Node`
  – Public abstract base class describing an interface for controlling a
    `bitcoind` node. Defined in [`interfaces.h`](interfaces.h).

* `ipc::NodeImpl`
  – Private concrete subclass of `ipc::Node` which implements the node
    interface by calling `libbitcoin` functions in the current `bitcoind`
    process. Defined in [`interfaces.cpp`](interfaces.cpp).

* `ipc::NodeClient`
  – Private concrete subclass of `ipc::Node` which implements the node
    interface by communicating with a `bitcoind` instance over a socket.
    Defined in [`client.cpp`](client.cpp).

* `ipc::messages::Node`
  – Private [capnp interface](https://capnproto.org/language.html#interfaces)
    describing communication across the IPC socket. Defined in
    [`messages.capnp`](messages.capnp).

* `ipc::NodeServer`
  – Private [capnp object](https://capnproto.org/rpc.html#distributed-objects)
    implementing the `ipc::messages::Node` interface and handling incoming
    requests by forwarding them to an `ipc::NodeImpl` object. Defined in
    [`server.cpp`](server.cpp).

`ipc::Wallet` and `ipc::Handler` are two other abstract interfaces similar to
`ipc::Node`, which allow an IPC client to keep track of wallets and callback
handlers, respectively. Both of these interfaces have corresponding private
`Impl`, `Client`, and `Server` subclasses just like `ipc::Node`.


### IPC Connection Setup Sequence ###

* IPC connection setup begins with an `ipc::StartClient()` call in `bitcoin-qt`.
  This creates a [socket pair](https://linux.die.net/man/3/socketpair) and
  spawns a `bitcoind` process to listen to one socket and a capnp event loop
  thread to listen to the other socket. Before returning, `StartClient`
  constructs an `ipc::NodeClient` object, which it returns to the caller so it
  can make IPC calls across the socket.

* When the `bitcoind` process starts, it calls `ipc::StartServer()`, which
  parses the command line to determine the socket file descriptor to listen for
  IPC requests from, then instantiates `ipc::NodeServer` and `ipc::NodeImpl`
  objects to handle the requests. After this, it invokes the capnp event loop,
  which just sits idle until the first request arrives.

### IPC Call Sequence Example ###

* When an IPC client calls the `NodeClient::getNodesStats()` method, the method
  will send a request over the IPC socket, triggering a call to
  `NodeServer::getNodesStats()` on the server, which will call
  `NodeImpl::getNodeStats()` to do the actual work.

### IPC Callback Sequence Example ###

* When an IPC client calls the `ipc::NodeClient::handleNotifyBlockTip()` method
  with a `std::function` argument, the method will first construct an
  `ipc::NotifyBlockTipCallbackServer` [capnp
  object](https://capnproto.org/rpc.html#distributed-objects) wrapping the
  `std::function`. It will then include a reference to this object inside the IPC
  request it sends to the server, so the server can call back to it.

* On the server side, the incoming IPC request will trigger a call to
  `ipc::NodeServer::handleNotifyBlockTip()` which will call
  `ipc::NodeImpl::handleNotifyBlockTip()`, passing the latter method a
  `std::function` will get registered to receive notifications. This server-side
  `std::function` will remotely invoke the
  `ipc::NotifyBlockTipCallbackServer::call()` method running in the client,
  which will invoke the original `std::function` passed to
  `ipc::NodeClient::handleNotifyBlockTip()` whenever there is a notification.

### Threading Notes ###

* Client methods like `ipc::NodeClient::getNodesStats()` will post work to the
  capnp event loop thread to send RPC requests and process responses, but will
  leave the event loop free to do other work between the sending the request
  and receiving the response. This means that multiple client IPC requests can
  execute simultaneously, and server callbacks can continue to be processed
  even while client IPC requests are pending.

* Server methods like `ipc::NodeServer::getNodesStats()` are called by _Cap'n
  Proto_ from the event loop thread, so it is important that they either run
  very quickly without blocking, or use an asynchronous mechanism like the
  `ipc::util::EventLoop::async()` helper to avoid tying up the server while the
  call is running. `ipc::NodeServer::appInit()` is an example of a slow IPC
  method that runs asynchronously using the async helper.

* Callback methods like `ipc::NotifyBlockTipCallbackServer::call()` are similar
  to server methods, and are also called from the event loop thread by _Cap'n
  Proto_. If they are blocking or slow, they also need to be implemented using
  an async mechanism to avoid slowing down other calls and callbacks.
